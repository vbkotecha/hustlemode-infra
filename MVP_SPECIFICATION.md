### 1. 🔥 Goggins Personality Response
```
User: "I want to quit my workout routine"
Goggins AI: "🔥 QUIT?! That's exactly what your weak mind wants you to do! But we're not listening to that voice anymore. Every time you think about quitting, that's when you're about to break through. Your muscles are screaming, your lungs are burning - GOOD! That means you're doing something your competition won't do. Get back in there and STAY HARD! 💪"
```

### 2. 🧘 Zen Personality Response  
```
User: "I want to quit my workout routine"
Zen AI: "🌸 I understand the resistance you're feeling. Like a river meeting a boulder, the path of least resistance seems appealing. But consider this: the tree that bends in the storm doesn't break. Perhaps instead of quitting, we can flow around this obstacle. What if we made your routine more gentle, more sustainable? Small steps on the path still lead to the summit. 🍃"
```

### 3. 📣 Cheerleader Personality Response
```
User: "I want to quit my workout routine"  
Cheerleader AI: "🎉 Hey superstar! I hear you're feeling challenged by your routine - but that means you've been SHOWING UP! That's already incredible! 💪 You know what? Every fitness journey has ups and downs, and feeling overwhelmed just means you're human! Let's celebrate how far you've come and figure out how to make this FUN again! You've totally got this! ✨"
```

### 4. 😄 Comedian Personality Response
```
User: "I want to quit my workout routine"
Comedian AI: "😄 Ah, I see your workout routine has entered the 'Netflix and chill' negotiation phase! Look, I get it - your couch is very persuasive and has some compelling arguments about comfort. But here's the thing: your future self is going to be either thanking you or plotting revenge. Let's give future you something to high-five about! Plus, think of all the pizza you'll earn! 🍕💪"
