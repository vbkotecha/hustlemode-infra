# HustleMode.ai Changelog

## [2.0.3] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
- **UI/UX**: Removed unwanted double quotes wrapping AI responses in both WhatsApp and Chat API
- AI responses now display cleanly without surrounding quotation marks
- Added quote stripping logic to Groq response processing in both functions
- Improved readability of coaching messages for better user experience

### Technical Details
- Added content processing to remove leading/trailing quotes from Groq API responses
- Applied fix to both `generateGroqResponse` functions in chat and WhatsApp handlers
- Maintains response integrity while cleaning presentation format
- Example: `"Stop making excuses!"` now displays as `Stop making excuses!`

## [2.0.2] - 2025-07-03

### Enhanced
- **MAJOR**: Dramatically increased conversation context memory from 3-5 exchanges to 20-30 exchanges
- Chat API now retrieves and uses 30 recent exchanges for context (up from 5)

- Updated `deployment-config.json` for both production and development environments  
- Modified shared `config.ts` to default to correct model with meta-llama prefix
- All Edge Functions now dynamically use environment variable instead of hardcoded model
- Phone numbers from WhatsApp API (without `+`) are now properly formatted for database constraint: `^\+\d{10,15}$`
- WhatsApp messages store phone numbers with `+` prefix but send API calls without prefix
- Simplified chat function dependencies to avoid complex utility import chains
- Tested full WhatsApp integration successfully with working Llama 4 Maverick model
- AI response generation now working: "Motivation is for amateurs. Discipline is what gets results. GET MOVING."

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-01-26] - Enhanced Universal Chat API with Contextual Responses

### 🏗️ Major Architecture Evolution: Best of Both Worlds

**Enhanced the accountability bot with hybrid intelligence** - Combined structured PostgreSQL data with Mem0's semantic intelligence for optimal performance and context awareness.

### ✅ Added Hybrid Intelligence System
- **PostgreSQL Foundation**: Maintained existing structured goal tracking, sessions, and operational data
  - Structured goal progress with measurable metrics (target_value, current_value, progress percentage)
  - Session management, rate limiting, and user preferences
  - Fast conversation history storage with message relevance classification
  - Cost-effective storage for large conversation histories
- **Mem0 Intelligence Layer**: Added behavioral pattern analysis and semantic memory on top
  - Automatic extraction of user behavioral patterns and motivational triggers  
  - Smart consolidation of conversation insights with contradiction resolution
  - Semantic search for "What helped before?" and "Similar challenges?" queries
  - 26% higher accuracy than OpenAI Memory with 90% token savings (per Mem0 research)

### 🔄 Enhanced Database Integration
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Added `sync_conversation_to_mem0()` for automatic behavioral analysis
- **Intent Classification**: Smart categorization of messages (goal_setting, progress_update, challenge_discussion, check_in)
- **Enhanced Context Retrieval**: `get_mem0_enhanced_context()` combines PostgreSQL facts with Mem0 insights
- **Hybrid Fallback**: Graceful degradation to PostgreSQL-only if Mem0 unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses structured data for facts, semantic intelligence for context

### 🤖 AI Response Improvements
- **Multi-Context Prompts**: AI receives both structured goals (PostgreSQL) and behavioral insights (Mem0)
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Responses reference specific goals AND user patterns
  - Example: "You're 16% toward your 25lb goal! For those cravings, remember protein snacks helped before."
- **Source Tracking**: Logs whether response used hybrid, PostgreSQL-only, or fallback context
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized context window using hybrid summary instead of full conversation history

### 🚀 Implementation Benefits
- **Preserved Investment**: All existing PostgreSQL work remains valuable and functional
- **Enhanced Intelligence**: Added semantic understanding without replacing structured approach
- **Cost Optimization**: Mem0's 90% token savings reduce AI processing costs significantly
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback layers ensure system always responds appropriately
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture supports advanced memory features while maintaining current functionality

### 🔧 Technical Enhancements
- **Hybrid Context Function**: `get_mem0_enhanced_context()` seamlessly combines data sources
- **Smart Sync Pipeline**: Non-blocking Mem0 sync doesn't impact response time
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback strategies for service unavailability
- **Logging Improvements**: Enhanced tracking of context sources and processing times

### 📊 Performance Gains

## [2025-01-24] - Universal Chat API with Function Calling

### Added
- **Contextual Response Generation**: AI now uses actual tool results to generate specific responses instead of generic ones
- **Improved Memory Search**: Multiple search strategies for better goal and user data retrieval  
- **Response Length Enforcement**: Automatic 8-12 word limit validation with personality consistency
- **Structured Memory Storage**: Better storage format for goals and user profiles to improve searchability

### Enhanced  
- **Tool Result Integration**: Responses now reference specific data found (e.g., "Welcome Alex!" instead of "User onboarded!")
- **Goal Retrieval Accuracy**: When asked "What are my goals?", bot now lists actual goal titles found
- **Personality Consistency**: Responses maintain ultra-concise format while being contextually relevant
- **Error Recovery**: Added comprehensive error handling to goal search to prevent crashes

### Fixed
- **Memory Contradictions**: Resolved issue where bot would say "Has no goals yet" when goals actually existed in Mem0
- **Generic Responses**: Fixed bot giving template responses instead of using actual data from tool results
- **Goal Search Reliability**: Improved search patterns to better match various goal storage formats in Mem0
- **Tool Execution Errors**: Added robust error handling to prevent tool failures from crashing the chat API

### Technical Improvements
- **Simplified Goal Search**: Streamlined search logic with better error handling and pattern matching
- **Multiple Search Terms**: Uses targeted search terms like "running", "fitness", "target", "goal" to find stored memories
- **Pattern Recognition**: Enhanced extraction of goals from different text patterns in Mem0 memories
- **Negative Memory Filtering**: Prevents storing contradictory "no goals" information when search may have failed

### Technical Details
- Added `generate_contextual_response_from_results()` function for tool-aware responses
- Enhanced `get_user_goals_tool()` with multiple search strategies and deduplication
- Implemented `enforce_response_length()` for personality constraint compliance
- Updated memory storage with structured metadata for better searchability

### Performance Impact
- Response generation now considers actual tool results (contextual vs generic)
- Memory searches optimized with targeted queries and result deduplication  
- Tool execution results properly inform final AI response generation
- Ultra-concise responses maintained while improving contextual relevance
